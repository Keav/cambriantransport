<h2>February 2009<br />
ERTMS Project at Shrewsbury</h2>

<p>Cambrian Transport has recently completed a depot installation for Network Rail at Shrewsbury for the ERTMS project. This required track to be laid into and out of the building using transition slabs. These are modular concrete floor units beneath the ballast at the entrances of the building.</p>

<p>Within the building is a workshop as well as facilities for battery storage and charging, oil separation and surface water disposal, and fuel storage in bunded tanks. Staff welfare amenities are also included with showers, drying rooms and toilets, together with offices. Security fencing has been erected around the whole site.</p>

<p>Because of the modular nature of the product range, depots can be erected quickly at competitive prices. An added bonus of the systems is that they can be recovered for reuse should circumstances change. Cambrian Transport are thus able to offer &#39;off-the-shelf&#39; sustainable solutions for new facilities at existing depots or completely new, fully-equipped depots on brown or green field sites.</p>

<h2>August 10th 2009<br />
Cambrian Transport Modular Tram Stop for Transport for London's Tramlink System at East Croydon</h2>

<p>Cambrian Transport have just completed a temporary tram stop at East Croydon, which was installed overnight on Saturday/ Sunday 8th/9th August.
The tram stop is required by TFL to create a temporary passenger interchange at East Croydon Station and allow east bound trams to terminate and return west bound while major track repair work is undertaken over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Cambrian Transport utilised their proven modular railway platform design to suit this unusual application. The platform deck units, which are delivered complete with coloured GRP non-slip surfacing, have been adapted to form a 330mm high tram stop, in contrast to the main line railway application where the platform is around 1 metre in height.</p>

<p>The tram stop is 23m long and 2.5 m wide, with a disabled access ramp at one end, and stepped access at the other. Tactile tiles were included to meet the Disabled Discrimination Act requirements for the visually impaired passengers.</p>

<p>The unique modular design allowed construction to be completed in double quick time, during a 5 hour overnight possession of the Tramlink, by a small team with minimal impact on the operation or the local environment.</p>

<p>Local people and businesses were surprised to find a new tram stop, complete with coated steel fencing, handrails and sign boards erected in George Street when they stirred on the Sunday morning. Only a few late night revellers witnessed the small team from Cambrian Transport as they pieced the light weight, pre-fabricated modular units together overnight to create the tram stop ready for use the following day.</p>

<p>The finished platform is a high quality, passenger friendly facility, with full disabled access, finished in bright pre coated finishes that give a pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>On completion of TFL's track works programme, the tram stop will be dismantled and moved to storage ready for use elsewhere on the system in the future should this be necessary.</p>

<p>'We are delighted to have been able to assist TFL in their programme of investment in the excellent Tramlink system, by providing one of our modular platforms to create this tram stop.</p>

<p>This is another example of how our modular systems can be adapted and constructed to meet challenging project timescales while providing an economic and high quality solution to our Client's requirements.</p>

<p>We are rapidly becoming the first stop for modular railway infrastructure solutions'.</p>
